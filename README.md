# Simple Search 

## Task
When given data sets to work with, we are required to produce applications which search and return refined data sets.
This is a simple search facility with pagination of the data sets provided.

The search is to do allow the matching of the following:
	•	location with exact and partial naming matches;
	•	near the beach;
	•	accepts pets;
	•	sleeps (minimum);
	•	beds (minimum);
	•	availability.

## Notes:
	•	It is simply a search facility.
	•	The results are paginated.
	•	This isn’t a web design
	•	Adopts an OOP approach.
